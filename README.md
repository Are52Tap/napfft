## NAPFFT (N8's Audio Player & FFT) Library

This project of mine was created with the intention of making a lightweight and hopefully versatile audio player with the capability of performing fast Fourier Transform for given audio files.

Currently, the project is missing the FFT functionality. I hope to add this soon.

This source code greatly modified by myself, is based upon and inspired by the following sources to which I owe much credit in getting this small project started:
+ Mathieu Rodic's [Libavcodec Tutorial](https://rodic.fr/blog/libavcodec-tutorial-decode-audio-file/)
+ Muzkaw's "Audio Spectrum FFT" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqUuMqfW1PE&ab_channel=Muzkaw) and [source code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2voedb-erQsR09PYnpaRnZKbGM/view)
+ ghedo's [Simple sound playback using ALSA API and libasound](https://gist.github.com/ghedo/963382/)
+ Paul Davis' [A Minimal Playback Program](http://equalarea.com/paul/alsa-audio.html)
+ Luca Barbato's explanation on the [New AVCodec API](https://blogs.gentoo.org/lu_zero/2016/03/29/new-avcodec-api/)
More specific credit is given near the source code most similar to the original work.
